- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chocalati
- 👀 I’m interested in web development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in php, CSS, java, JavaScript, C#, reactjs
- 💞️ I’m new to this, fresh graduate
- 📫 How to reach me https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-glen-encenzo-22abb92a2
- 😄 Pronouns: ChukoLit
- ⚡ Fun fact: Many fresh graduates experience what's called "imposter syndrome,"
-    where they doubt their accomplishments and feel like they don't belong in their new roles.
-    In fact, studies show that up to 70% of people experience this at some point in their careers!
-    It's a common feeling, but with time and experience, most graduates find their confidence and place in the workforce.
-    I'm one of those who is confused but I'm not giving up I will continue to pursue my passion in coding,  even though I'm lost right now.
-    I will find Roger treasure!!
